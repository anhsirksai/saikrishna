## open vz notes:

- [link to virtualization intro paper](http://download.openvz.org/doc/openvz-intro.pdf)

- Three main virtualization approaches:
```emulation```
``` para-virtualization```
``` operating-system level virtualization```
```Multi-server  (cluster) virtualization.```

- Main kernal components:
```isolation and virtualization```
```resource management```
```check-pointing```
```live migration```

- Emulations:
..* Imitation of behavior of a computer or other electronic system with the help of another type of computer/system. to run any non-modified operating system.
..* The main disadvantages of emulation are low performance and low density.
..* Examples: VMware products, QEmu , Bochs , Parallels

- Paravirtualization :
..* Is a technique to run multiple modified OSs on top of a thin layer called a hypervisor, or virtual machine monitor.
..* Here guest OS needs to be modified.
..* Examples: Xen , UML.

- Operating system-level virtualization :
..* multiple isolated execution environments within a single operating system kernel.
..*  features dynamic resource management.
..* FreeBSD Jail , Solaris Zones/Containers ,Linux-VServer,OpenVZ and Virtuozzo.
